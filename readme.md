# ML Colonizer

DQLearning, reaserching neural networks is interesting stuff.
In this repo i'm developing one of them, not a nativ english speaker btw.

The project consists of 3 mayor components, the environment and the agent.

The agent observes the environment and executes different actions.
The environment is changed by those actions resulting in a changing of the agents input.

Tbd. Observer component.

# Setup

1. Change directory to '''cd environment''' and install the environment: '''pip3 install -e . --user'''
3. Install required packages: numpy, pytorch etc. (pull request welcome for requirements.txt)
